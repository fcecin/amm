# Logging in

UtilityX is a fully-decentralized Web3 platform. To use UtilityX, you must have:

* A supported Web3 wallet installed (for example, [Anchor](https://www.greymass.com/anchor));

* An account on the [UX Network](https://uxnetwork.io) blockchain;

* Your account's private key already stored on your Web3 wallet.

If you have met all these prerequisites, you can click on the **Login / SignUp** button on the top right:

A pop-up window should appear, which will allow you to select your Web3 wallet (for example, Anchor). You must have an UX Network account, and the Web3 wallet you select must already have that account loaded in it.

When you click on the button that will connect you to your Web3 wallet of choice, the UtilityX website on your browser will initiate a procedure to connect to your specific Web3 wallet. This procedure will depend on the Web3 wallet you have chosen.

As an example, the connection procedure for Anchor may open a pop-up with a QR Code image in it, and an _Open Anchor app_ link below the QR code, which you can click to connect if you are using the Desktop version of Anchor.

When you are successfully logged in, you should see, in the top right corner, the name of the blockchain and name of your account:

> **_NOTE:_** All the example screen images in this guide will picture an UX Network account named `testutilityx`. Naturally, you will be using your own account, which will display a different name.
